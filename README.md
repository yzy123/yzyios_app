# yzyios_app

  * This is the individual ios application development practice for Zhiyi Yang
  * For the ios app without firebase just download StreetBrand file and execute the "StreetBrand.xcodeproj" file in it
 Â 
  * For the ios app with firebase email account login in UI, please download the "StreetBrand_firebase_finish.zip" and execute "StreetBrand.xcworkspace" file in it.
  
  * For video Demo, please download iosapp_demo_c.mp4
  
  * For the sprint please check https://trello.com/b/KPCUwybD/ios-app

  * For unit test, the AWS Device Farm only support the app whose development target is ios10.0 or below, thus the street_brand app can't be test in AWS Device Farm since its development target is ios11.0. Thus the demo app FoodTracker from apple development website will be tested. To see the report, please check EC601_unit_test.pdf and Test_Case_Yzy. The simulation video record is yzy_iosapp_test.mp4
